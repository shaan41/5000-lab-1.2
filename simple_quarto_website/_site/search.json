I think providing that analysis to the customer is most important as that determines what they need to do and what cost measures they have to accomplish.↩︎"

Thus the studies of Data science using analytics and data will continue to develop the AI model not just for Betting but everything in the world as well.\n\n1\nBetting will increase like how this line graph is! Every year more people will begin doing it more and set new records.\nMore on this topic about Sports betting can be checked with this article [@nichols2014impact]\n#| echo: true\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nx = [3,4,7,8,12] \ny = [2,7,8,10,15] \n\nplt.plot(x,y)\nplt.xlabel('x-axis')\nplt.ylabel('y-axis')\nplt.show()"
