    "## The results of this example \n",
    "\n",
    "- People would be able to use AI or run simulations to see who they should bet on to increase their chances on winning. \n",
    "- It would result in more people attempting to gamble and the companies who make these probability machines such as AWS will benefit from it. Thus the studies of Data science using analytics and data will continue to develop the AI model not just for Betting but everything in the world as well.\n",
