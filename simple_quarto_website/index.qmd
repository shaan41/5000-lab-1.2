Learn more about my definiton of a data scientist here[^1]

[^1]: My definition of a data scientist is that someone who goes in and collects/clean data and help provide a visualization for the client and provide an in depth analysis of what's going on with their data and analysis on how to improve on these results. I think providing that analysis to the customer is most important as that determines what they need to do and what cost measures they have to accomplish. 

## Qoutes from each reference that stood out
### Reference 1: BEX: A versatile multiplex optical imaging approach for deep phenotyping and spatial analysis of cells in complex tissues
> "The ability to use IBEX in its native format and with the Opal-plex variation is especially valuable in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary data show that these methods work well with highly fixed postmortem samples from such patients"

You can read more about these studies of cells in the article [@Radtke2020-hd]

### Reference 2: The Impact of Visiting Team Travel on Game Outcome and Biases in NFL Betting Markets
> "Unlike security prices, where uncertainty regarding the full information or fundamental value makes comparison with the actual security price difficult, the outcome of a sporting event is known, allowing a comparison with the expected outcome, or betting line, to be easily made"
